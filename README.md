# Data Cleaning AI Agent

**An automated tool that cleans messy datasets so I don't have to keep rewriting the same code.**

Built as a fun weekend project because I was tired of copy-pasting data cleaning code between projects.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd GitHub_AI_Agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_example.py
```

## What's Inside

- **`GitHub_AI_Agent/`** - The actual working code (use this!)
- **Documentation files** - Various guides I wrote while building this

## Full Documentation

See [GitHub_AI_Agent/README.md](./GitHub_AI_Agent/README.md) for complete docs.

## What It Does

- Fixes missing values
- Removes duplicates
- Detects outliers
- Standardizes column names
- Scores data quality

**No API keys. No configuration. Just works.**
